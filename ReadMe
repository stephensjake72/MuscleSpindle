This code base is for the purpose of processing and analyzing the data in Abbott et al 2023.
The first script utilized is in the Spike 2 language for automating the export of data to MATLAB. Processing scripts are written in MATLAB, with statistical analysis scripts in R.

To repeat this analysis, first run export exportSpikeFiles.s2s to export Spike2 data files to MATLAB.
Next, run dataSorting.m to parse experiment files into individual stretch periods.
